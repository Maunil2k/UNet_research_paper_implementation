# UNet Research Paper Implementation
This repository shows a modified implementation of research paper: U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation using Tensorflow. Further, the model was trained on HubMap HPA Dataset. The training results have been uploaded as well in the CSV file. Similarly, the loss chart and f1 score chart for the same are also uploaded.<br />
Some modifications have been made in the implementation with respect to the model displayed in original paper. The size of the input image has been altered in order to get the same sized mask.
